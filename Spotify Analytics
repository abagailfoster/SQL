-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)
;
-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData;

-- Which artists are on this list more than once and which artist is on the list the most?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name) >= 2
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc;

-- Which songs on here featuring another artist has the highest popularity?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat%'
ORDER BY popularity desc;

-- Are there any songs where the time signature isn't four?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, time_signature
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
WHERE time_signature <> '4';

-- What is the average song duration in minutes?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(duration_ms)/60000,2)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData;

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, ROUND(avg(s.popularity),1) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
