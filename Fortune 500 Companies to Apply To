-- Let's review our data to see what questions we can ask

SELECT *
FROM fortune_companies;

-- From this we found there are 43 companies listed.

-- I'd like to begin a new career with one of the companies from the list, but I am only interested in the top companies ranked off employee satisfaction. I'll be using avg_employee_tenure, paid_time_off_days, and whether they offer healthcare_benefits to see where I would like to apply.

-- First, off I can right away remove any companies that do not offer healthcare_benefits from this list.

SELECT COUNT(company_name)
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- Cool, we knocked off 13 companies and there are 30 remaining, let's see what they are

SELECT *
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE healthcare_benefits = 1;

--Next I want to stay at my job a long time, let's see what the average of the average employee tenure is to filter the companies for above average tenure.

SELECT ROUND(AVG (avg_employee_tenure), 1)
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- Now we know that the average, average_employee_tenure is 6.2 years - let's filter the results to show the companies with above average average tenure that also offer health benefits.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE avg_employee_tenure > 6.2
AND healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- This filtered our results to 13 companies, let's see what they are:

SELECT *
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE avg_employee_tenure > 6.2
AND healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- Next we will see what the average PTO days are of the remaining results.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(paid_time_off_days))
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE avg_employee_tenure > 6.2
AND healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- The average PTO days offered of the companies are 19, let's see how many of the remaining companies offer more than 19 PTO days. 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE avg_employee_tenure > 6.2
AND healthcare_benefits = 1
AND paid_time_off_days > 19;

-- Great, we're down to 8 companies! Let's use a case statement to find these results instead.

SELECT company_name,
CASE WHEN paid_time_off_days > 19 then 'Above Average'
WHEN paid_time_off_days = 19 then 'Average'
WHEN paid_time_off_days < 19 then 'Below Average'
END AS 'Average PTO Days'
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE avg_employee_tenure > 6.2
AND healthcare_benefits = 1;

-- Awesome, I will be applying to those companies. :)
